PRACTICE:

Your task is to make a method that takes a List of Products, a Conditional and an Action as arguments.
Method should iterate through the List and apply a filter using the Conditional. On each Product passing the filter you apply the Action.
You will have to make Lambda Implementations to help you accomplish the following scenarios.
• Print out all Products that have stock value of 0.
• Print out the productName of all the Products that starts with B.
• Print out all Products that have price above 100 AND lower than 150
• Increase the price of all products that have a stock value of less than 10 AND above 0 by 50%
